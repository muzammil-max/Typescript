// var , const and let
export
let myname = "icecream";//ice cream
// let myname = "Hassan" un commenting this code will give error because in let we cannot again use let command.In javascript there was no let or const so var was used but the problem of var was that the variable weith same could be made ( 2 child with same name ) 
myname = "mutter kay danay";//mutter dana
console.log(myname)
